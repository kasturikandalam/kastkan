				This space is my ongoing experiment in learning by doing — an attempt to recreate figures from economics papers 
                that have shaped how I think about development and data. Some are full replications, others just visual exercises 
                to test an idea or method.

						This figure demonstrates a crucial requirement for Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Design (FRDD): the running variable must be unmanipulable by treatment recipients. The smooth distribution shows that districts couldn't strategically manipulate their backwardness scores to secure earlier NREGS phase allocation.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Why this matters:</strong> The normalized rank variable is based on the Planning Commission's Backwardness Index published in 2003, using data from NSS 50th (1993-1994) and 55th (1999-2000) rounds—collected years before NREGS was conceived in 2006. Districts had no foresight to strategically misreport information in the 1990s for a program that wouldn't exist until a decade later.
					</p>
					<p>
						The smooth, continuous distribution—without bunching or gaps near phase cutoffs—provides visual evidence against manipulation. This institutional and empirical evidence establishes that the running variable was predetermined and exogenous to treatment assignment.
