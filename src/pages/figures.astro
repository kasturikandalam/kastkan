						<p>
							This figure replicates Figure 2 from Zimmermann (2012) and illustrates an essential diagnostic for Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Designs (FRDDs): the running variable must be exogenous to treatment assignment and unmanipulable by those who might benefit from it.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Why this matters:</strong> In the context of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), districts were phased into the program based on their Backwardness Rank, derived from the Planning Commission's Backwardness Index (2003). The index itself was constructed using data from the NSS 50th (1993–94) and 55th (1999–2000) rounds—collected well before NREGS was enacted in 2006. Consequently, districts had neither the foresight nor the incentive to strategically misreport indicators used to generate these backwardness scores.
						</p>
						<p>
                           The smooth, monotonic relationship between the Three-Parameter Index and Backwardness Rank provides both institutional and empirical reassurance that the running variable was not subject to manipulation. 
                            <!--There is no bunching or discontinuity near program thresholds, supporting the assumption that phase assignment was determined by predetermined characteristics rather than endogenous behavior. -->						</p>
